**Prerequisites**: Basic knowledge of quantum mechanics.

If you satisfy the above prerequisite you already know how weird quantum mechanics is, mainly because it goes against our intuition and general understanding of the world. But, if you don't know about quantum entanglement you are missing out on arguably the weirdest part of this theory. Einstein himself was baffled by it, terming it as *'spooky action at a distance'*. In this post I'll try to develop the concept of quantum entanglement, show its application in the double slit experiment and also talk about the Bell state and the (in)famous EPR paradox. In doing this, I will introduce you to tensor product states, reduced density operator and von Neuman measurements. Buckle up, because this one is going to be a long post and I might end up writing it over a couple of days, or more. O'll tell you how many it was at end end!
