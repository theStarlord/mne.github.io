**Prerequisites**: Basic knowledge of quantum mechanics.

If you satisfy the above prerequisite you already know how weird quantum mechanics is, mainly because it goes against our intuition and general understanding of the world. But, if you don't know about quantum entanglement you are missing out on arguably the weirdest part of this theory. Einstein himself was baffled by it, terming it as *'spooky action at a distance'*. In this post I'll try to develop the concept of quantum entanglement, show its application in the double slit experiment and also talk about the Bell state and the (in)famous EPR paradox. In doing this, I will introduce you to tensor product states, reduced density operator and von Neuman measurements. Buckle up, because this one is going to be a long post!

**Defining quantum entanglement-**

Systems $$S_{1}$$ and $$S_{2}$$ are said to be entangled if the state of the composite system $$S$$ cannot be written as the tensor product state:

$$ \ket{\psi} = \ket{\alpha}\otimes\ket{\beta} = \ket{\alpha}\ket{\beta} $$

where $$\ket{\alpha}$$ and $$\ket{\beta}$$ are the state kets of $$S_{1}$$ and $$S_{2}$$ respectively. Here, taking the tensor product which is represented by the symbol $$\otimes$$, in non-technical manner, can be understood as considering the two systems together. So, if the two systems are not entangled, i.e. the composite state is given by $$\ket{\alpha}\ket{\beta}$$, it means that each subsystem possesses its own quantum state, meaning that each subsystem can be completely described (using their respective quantum state) independently of the other subsystem and there is no physical property that can be measured only using the composite state and not the individual states of the subsystems. Thus, each subsystem even after being part of a larger system retain their identity, if not entangled. This is similar to the classical case. Hence, quantum entanglement is said to be the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics that marks its departure from classical physics.
