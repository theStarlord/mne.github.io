Yayy! Seems we have some upgrades. I have a new blog. Why? Because change is a good thing. I recently switched from Windows 10 to Arch Linux with GNOME and decided to shift my blog from blogspot to one using Jekyll. One of the major motivations for this step was the easy use of LaTeX on the new blog. In the earlier one I had to first write the equations using LaTeX, compile them and take a screenshot of the output and insert it as an image in my blog. Now, I can just do this,

$$ 3 \int_{0}^{x} x^{2} dx = x^{3}$$

or this,

$$ e^{i\pi} = 1$$

Fun, isn't it?


Moving on, what else has changed? For one, I will be more regular. Earlier, I only used to put some very relevant stuff on the blog. This would include an idea that I came up with, or some topic that I studied or wished to study. While all those things are obviously staying, what I would like to add to this one is more personal stuff, like how I feel about a certain subject, or a certain book or a specific approach towards some topic. 


Why would I want to do that?
This is because I don't see this blog as me trying to explain my thoughts and decisions to an audience. I see this as a way of me talking to myself and trying to realize things I normally wouldn't. If in process of doing that I end up with am organized journal of my adventures in physics and mathematics, then why the hell not?



If someone does end up reading this stuff at some point of time, well, welcome. This is just me talking to myself about things I am passionate about, namely physics and mathematics. I hope you'll have a good time.
